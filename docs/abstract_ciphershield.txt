The exponential growth of digital content consumption, particularly in the form of video data, underscores the critical need for robust security measures to prevent unauthorized usage and copyright infringement of video data. This work introduces another level of hybrid cryptographic approach, specifically tailored to secure video files by leveraging a hybrid encryption model that combines the asymmetric power of RSA and dynamic AES key management. Unlike conventional methods, our approach dynamically generates unique AES keys for each chunk of video data, using system-unique identifiers and elliptic curve equations, thereby enhancing the security and adaptability of the encryption process. The proposed system is implemented through a sophisticated software solution that features dedicated modules for video encryption and decryption. This system ensures that video files are securely encrypted, with keys regenerated dynamically to maintain resilience against attacks. Rigorous testing and evaluation demonstrate the system's superiority in both security and performance metrics, proving it to be an effective solution for combating modern challenges such as copyright infringement and piracy. This research offers a significant contribution to the field of file security, presenting a cutting-edge cryptographic implementation that meets the evolving demands of digital content protection.
